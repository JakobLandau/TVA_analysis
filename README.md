Method for identify and the effect size of driver mutations in cancer genes based on cancer selection .

1. Create_dataframe.py was used to form the drivers catalogue table with many features used in the papers analyses.
2. raw_data a directory that containts files used to create the dataframes including: 
	2.1 CosmicTranscripts: table of transcripts for cancer genes from COSMIC with selection of main transcript
	2.2 EnsemblTranscripts: table of all possible transcripts for all genes from Ensembl
	2.3 dbNSFP_CSD_per_gene: a directory that contains different DBNSFP+CSD table for every possible transcript of selected cancer genes
